Jamie has been efficient in scoping the project, defining the variables to achieve optimum functionality, sizing and estimating time required and knowledgeable in guiding some of the decisions needing to be made around scope and function of the project. It has been a very smooth, professional process with Jamie. He has been very easy to deal with. I would highly recommend Jamie and we will be using his services and skills again. Thanks Jamie!"
